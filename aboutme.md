My name is Dorothy Gasque, I am a student in Lambda School's Data Science program. I have a B.S. in Mathematics from Portland State University. I have experience in leadership and working with cross-functional teams. In my spare time I enjoy hiking and serve as the Treasurer of the Clark County Democrats. Before attending college, I served in the US Army as an electronic missile systems technician.
