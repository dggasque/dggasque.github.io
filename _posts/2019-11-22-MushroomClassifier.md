## Predictive Modeling Using the UCI Machine Learning Mushroom Dataset

[Edible or Regrettable](https://edible-or-regrettable.herokuapp.com/) is an application that uses
a random forest classifier to predict whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible. The data is sourced
from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification). It was originally donated to the
UCI Machine Learning Repository in 1987.

The application is built using Plotly's Dash Platform.

Other python libraries used include: Category Encoders, ELI5, Matplotlib, Pandas, PDPbox, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn.
